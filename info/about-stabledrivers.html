              <p style="font-family: arial;">The stable driver tag I have on some of the driver download pages refers to community feedback and response to newley release drivers. I usually look at reddit threads regarding a new driver release, and if the general outlook is that the driver seems to be working well and is worth an update, I put that specific text next to the driver version with a link to the thread I used to determine adding that tag.</p>
