# DriverHub.win
A website that lists common drivers and their native download links all in one place!

## 🙌 Simplistic
Intuative yet minimalistic UI allowing for easy viewing in both light or dark mode.

## ⭐ Features
- Simplistic GUI for easy navigation
- SHA256 file hashes available for all new drivers after version 4.1.0
- Reigon selection to those between EU and US based servers for driver downloads (on supported drivers [see more](https://docs.rexxit.net/drivers-website/articles/region-selection)).

## 🌐 Resources
- [Driver List Data](https://github.com/BurntToasters/driverHub-data)

## ⬇️ Direct downloads
Downloads of any/all drivers on this website go the official companies download URL's and are **NOT** redistributed by me. This site is simply a "hub" for common drivers (such as video drivers).
